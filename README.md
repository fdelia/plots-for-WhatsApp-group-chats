# Plots for WhatsApp group chats

* Works for iPhone WhatsApp chats only so far *

## Setup and install dependencies
In a terminal do:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fdelia/plots-for-WhatsApp-group-chats.git
cd plots-for-WhatsApp-group-chats
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Use
* Export the whatsapp chat: On iOS click on chat name / contact name and scroll down. You don't need to export the media.
* You get a `_chat.txt` file.
* Copy it into the folter `plots-for-WhatsApp-group-chats`
* In the folder run `python analyze.py`

## Info
The script is messy. Ask me if you have questions.
